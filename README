mp3chop
=======

A natty little utility for extracting bits of ADTS MP3 and AAC
files. It does this by walking the frames of the file knowing how much
audio they will generate and enables/disables output as appropriate
depending on the timecode associated with the frame. It doesn't
actually understand the contents of the frames. MP3 frames can contain
references to other frames and often do. This means that mp3chop can
generate output that contains references to frames that do not exist
in the output. Because the MP3 is a streaming format decoders should
deal with this correctly and glean what information they can from the
frames before discarding them if they cannot produce audio from
them. Some decoders may output a diagnostic such as "frame discarded"
when this happens. AAC ADTS frames are always self contained so this
problem does not occur.

To install, run:

 ./configure && make install

The usual configure options are accepted and more documentation for
configure is provided in the INSTALL file.

 man ./mp3chop.1
 mp3chop --help
