I have high hopes for this program but I don't seem to get the time to
work on it. Anyway, here's a few ideas.

Complex chops
=============
The Chop classes in chop.h allude to a more versatile mechanism for
specifying which frames should be output. It would be nice for the program
to take a file that contained lines something like this:

  outfile1: (t < 00:10:00) || (t > 00:20:00)
  outfile2: (t >= 00:10:00) && (t <= 00:20:00)

Of course, this would be good for the command line to, just a single
expression could be specified. This would be particularly good for removing 
the musical interludes from Goon Shows for example.

Graphical UI
============
Specifying the above using some sort of graphical UI. The code short port
to Windows relatively easily and there is scope for factoring out the real
implementation to some sort of library that can be used by multiple UI
implementations (e.g. Gnome, KDE, Win32).

Simple cleanups
===============

Catch errors from close(2) in FileDataSink:Close()

Add more unit-tests including a 64-bit unit test (it might take a
while to run.)
