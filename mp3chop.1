.TH MP3CHOP 1 "25th September 2006"
.SH NAME
mp3chop \- A tool for chopping up MP3 files.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmp3chop\fP [ -b \Fitime\Fp | --begin=\FiTIME\Fp ] [ -e \FiTIME\Fp | --end=\Fitime\Fp ]
        [ --strip-id3=1 | -s 1 ] [ --strip-id3=2 | -s 2 ]
        [ --copyright=0|1 | -c 0|1 ] [ --original=0|1 | -o 0|1 ]
        [ --dump-header | -d ] [ \fIINPUT FILE\fP ]

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBmp3chop\fP is a tool for extracting bits of mp3 files. It does this by walking
the frames of the file knowing how much audio each frame generates and
enables/disables output as appropriate depending on the timecode associated
with the frame. It doesn't actually understand the contents of the
frames. MP3 frames can contain references to other frames and often
do. This means that mp3chop can generate output that contains references to
frames that do not exist in the output. Because the MP3 is a streaming
format decoders should deal with this correctly and glean what information
they can from the frames before discarding them if they cannot produce
audio from them. Some decoders may output a diagnostic such as "frame
discarded" when this happens.

Whilst processing the file \fBmp3chop\fP also checks for obvious corruption
within the frame headers by checking that they occur at the specified
offset from the previous frame. Any frames that fail this test are not
output until a good header is found.

\fBmp3chop\fP can also be used for dumping the headers of frames, forcing
the copyright and original flags and stripping \fIID3v1\fP and \fIID3v2\fP
tags.

\fBmp3chop\fP expects to read the MP3 file either on standard input or from
the supplied filename and writes to standard output.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-b\fP, --begin\fP=\fITIME\fP
Do not output any of the frames that are before \fITIME\fP in the
input. \fITIME\fP must be in the form '\fBmm:ss.hh\fP' where \fBmm\fP
indicates minutes, \fBss\fP indicates seconds and \fBhh\fP indicates
hundredths of a second.
.TP
\fB-e\fP, \fB--end\fP=\fITIME\fP
Do not output any of the frames that are after \fITIME\fP in the input.
\fITIME\fP must be in the form '\fBmm:ss.hh\fP' where \fBmm\fP indicates
minutes, \fBss\fP indicates seconds and \fBhh\fP indicates hundredths of a
second.
.TP
\fB-s\fP, \fB--strip-id3\fP=\fIVERSION\fP 
Do not output ID3 tags of the specified version (either 1 or 2). This
option may be specified multiple times for different versions.
.TP
\fB-h\fP, \fB--help\fP
Display short usage information and exit.
.TP
\fB-d\fP, \fB--dump-header\fP
Output a description of the header of the first valid frame to standard
output. Disables the output of any MP3 data to standard output.
.TP
\fB-D\fP, \fB--dump-all-headers\fP
Output a description of the header of every frame in the file to standard
output. Disables the output of any MP3 data to standard output.
.TP
\fB-c\fP, \fB--copyright\fP=\fI0\fP|\fI1\fP
Ensure that the copyright flag is set to the specified value in any frames
that are output.
.TP
\fB-o\fP, \fB--original\fP=\fI0\fP|\fI1\fP
Ensure that the original flag is set to the specified value in any frames
that are output.
.SH EXAMPLES
Extract ten seconds from the file \fBtune.mp3\fP starting at thirty seconds
in and write to \fBtune_edit.mp3\fP:
.IP
.B mp3chop -b 0:30.00 -e 0:40.00 tune.mp3 > tune_edit.mp3
.PP
Validate the frames in the file \fBtune.mp3\fP and output the clean version
to \fBtune_clean.mp3\fP:
.IP
.B mp3chop < tune.mp3 > tune_clean.mp3
.PP
